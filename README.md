# Defending IaaS with ATT&CK

Organizations using Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) need to identify the
MITRE ATT&CK® techniques that are pertinent to that architecture, whether they
affect container technology, virtual machine technology, or the cloud management
control plane. The Defending IaaS with ATT&CK project consists of a collection
of ATT&CK techniques that target a typical Linux IaaS architecture, as well as
methodology to build custom collections that are tailored to any unique
organization and scenario. The Defending IaaS collection can be used as-is; it
can be customized and extended; or the methodology can be employed to create
entirely new collections.

## Getting Started

The best place to start is with the documentation: this will familiarize you
with the project, the methodology, and resulting collection of techniques. Next,
view the collection in ATT&CK Navigator. For a deeper dive, upgrade to the
latest version of ATT&CK Workbench and use its new features to create your own
collections.

| Resource | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [Documentation](https://center-for-threat-informed-defense.github.io/defending-iaas-with-attack/) | Documentation for Defending IaaS with ATT&CK, including methodology and technical deep dive. |
| [ATT&CK Navigator](https://center-for-threat-informed-defense.github.io/attack-navigator/) | A customized ATT&CK Navigator that embeds the Defending IaaS collection under the "Create New Layer" option. |
| [ATT&CK Workbench](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/attack-workbench-frontend) | Upgrades to ATT&CK Workbench facilitate creating new collections for projects such as this one. |
| [Defending IaaS Collection](/data/defending-iaas-0.1.json/) | The collection of techniques represented as a machine-readable STIX bundle. |

## Getting Involved

There are several ways that you can get involved with this project and help
advance threat-informed defense:

- **Review the collection using ATT&CK Navigator or ATT&CK Workbench.**
  Navigator is the easiest way to get started, using the resource link above. If
  you are already a Workbench user, you will find that the latest version
  includes new capabilities that are helpful for creating custom collections.
- **Read the methodology.** The Defending IaaS collection is helpful in its own
  right, but the methodology is provided so that organizations can create
  tailored collections to meet their own needs.
- **Build and share your own collections!** This project provides the
  methodology and tools needed to build collections tailored to any need. You
  can build proprietary collections to use within your organization, or you can
  publish collections to benefit the community.
