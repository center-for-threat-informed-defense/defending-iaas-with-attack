# Defending IaaS with ATT&CK

Organizations using Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) need to identify the
MITRE ATT&CK速 techniques that are pertinent to that architecture, whether they
affect container technology, virtual machines, or the cloud management control
plane. The Defending IaaS with ATT&CK project consists of a collection of ATT&CK
techniques that target a notional Linux IaaS architecture, as well as
methodology to build custom collections that can be tailored to any unique
organization and scenario. The Defending IaaS collection can be used as-is, or
the methodology can be employed to develop entirely new collections.

## Getting Started

The best place to start is with the documentation: this will familiarize you with the
project goals, the methodology, and the collection of techniques. For a deep dive,
upgrade to the latest version of ATT&CK Workbench and use its new features to create
your own collections.

| Resource | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [Documentation](https://center-for-threat-informed-defense.github.io/defending-iaas-with-attack/) | Documentation for Defending IaaS with ATT&CK, including methodology and technical deep dive. |
| [ATT&CK Workbench](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/attack-workbench-frontend) | Upgrades to ATT&CK Workbench facilitate creating new collections for projects such as this one. |
| [Defending IaaS Collection](./data/) | The collection of techniques in Excel format as well as a machine-readable format (STIX). |

## Getting Involved

There are several ways that you can get involved with this project and help
advance threat-informed defense:

- **Review the collection using ATT&CK Navigator or ATT&CK Workbench.**
  Navigator is the easiest way to get started, using the resource link above. If
  you are already a Workbench user, you will find that the latest version
  includes new capabilities that are helpful for creating custom collections.
- **Read the methodology.** The Defending IaaS collection is helpful in its own
  right, but the methodology is provided so that organizations can create
  tailored collections to meet their own needs.
- **Build and share your own collections!** This project provides the
  methodology and tools needed to build collections tailored to any need. You
  can build proprietary collections to use within your organization, or you can
  publish collections to benefit the community.
