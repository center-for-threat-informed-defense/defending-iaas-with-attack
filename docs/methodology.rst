.. note::
  "CISA's Cloud Security Technical Reference Architecture report referenced above uses the National Institute for Standards and Technology Special Publication 800-145: The NIST Definition of Cloud Computing as:“Consumers have the capability to provision computing resources to deploy and run environments and applications. Cloud providers manage the underlying infrastructure while the consumers have control over the computing resources, including some control of selected networking components…”


Cyber Threat Model Methodology
-----------------------------

The cyber threat model methodology consists of 5 steps:

1.  Identify the Attack Surface– select the domains and platforms to include in the threat model

    The Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) attack surface is defined as adversary activities against the cloud management layer, container technology, or on hosted infrastructure.

2.  Compile Source Data– Identify and import sets of ATT&CK techniques

    MITRE ATT&CK techniques applicable to IaaS are currently spread across Cloud (IaaS), Container, and Linux platforms. The first step to identify an applicable subset of techniques is to combine the data sets from these three platforms. The Cloud and Container platforms in ATT&CK for Enterprise describe adversary techniques at the cloud management and container technology layers, but do not include techniques that apply to the system being hosted. Similarly, while the Linux platform captures all techniques that can be used on Linux systems, not all are applicable to cloud-hosted Linux servers or to Linux containers. Some techniques (e.g., Event-Triggered Execution: Screensaver - T1546.002) do not apply to headless, hosted Linux because the affected service or feature is disabled or hidden. The final collection of techniques that encompass attack surface for IaaS is a combination of techniques in the Cloud (IaaS) platform, the Container platform, and a subset of the techniques in the Linux platform.

3.  Define Selection Criteria–  Specify the rules used to include or exclude techniques
    The selection criteria for the IaaS will focus on techniques that are applicable to the cloud and container-based instances of Linux, to also include management and orchestration applications and utilities available from service providers.
    For Iaas, the criteria used to select techniques can be further defined into three areas of focus: physical, operational, and environmental.
    Physical criteria are used to determine if the collection will include techniques based on physical characteristics of the system. Techniques in this section would exclude attacks that target the underlying physical technology. Examples of these components include physical servers, firmware, hypervisor, and some elements of networking.
+   Exclude techniques that rely on physical access or that target hardware (physical servers, firmware, hypervisor, and networking hardware)

+   Exclude techniques that target service provider-managed components, such as physical security, storage, servers, and virtualization

    Operational criteria are used to determine if the collection will include techniques based on functional characteristics such as how the system is intended to operate. There are numerous definitions of cloud service models.
    Examples of these technology components include operating system (Linux), applications, networking, authentication and access management services.

    +   Exclude techniques specific to workstations, or that are apply to end-users, including Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI), or similar workspace-as-a-service offerings
    +   Exclude operating system services and components that manage hardware or system components
    +   Exclude applications and extensions that are typically associated with workstation or end-user systems, such as email clients and web browser
    +   Include 3rd party applications and runtimes, for example SQL server or Java, with the condition that the underlying technology are present
    +   Include tools provided by service provider, or 3rd parties, that are used to build and orchestrate cloud systems

    Environmental criteria are used to determine if the collection takes into consideration exceptional aspects or characteristics that are specific to the environment. This section intends to address nuances of adversary behavior that may vary, depending on the environment’s technology deployment or operations.

    +   Exclude techniques that do not align with common best practices for IaaS, for example, automated provisioning, scaling, and data recovery
    +   Exclude techniques that require end-user interaction

4. Review Applicable Techniques
Apply the selection criteria defined in (3) to the combined set of ATT&CK techniques identified in (2). Adding comments to explain the rationale behind each technique will be helpful when modifying the collection through periodic reviews, or as needed when the organization and systems change.
+   T1052.001: Exfiltration over Physical Medium: Exfiltration over USB – this technique is excluded from the collection as it relies on adversary access to physical media, which is out of scope for IaaS physical criteria

+   T1059: Command and Scripting Interpreter – this technique is included in the collection as IaaS-hosted systems often use command and scripting interpreters in their operation and administration

5. Create a Collection
The final step is to publish the techniques in a collection. Use ATT&CK Workbench API access, or export the customized collection as a STIX bundle, and import into ATT&CK Navigator to display a matrix and interactively navigate and define custom views using layers.

.. note::
  “A collection is a set of related ATT&CK objects; collections may be used to represent specific releases of a dataset such as "Enterprise ATT&CK v7.2", or any other set of objects one may want to share with someone else. Collections are meant to be shared. Collections can be shared as STIX bundles…”


Scope
-----
This methodology does not include adding or extending other sources of CTI into the ATT&CK knowledge base. The resulting threat model from this process does not provide a risk determination, such as the likelihood that attack my occur and the resulting impact. The methodology does not provide a scoring rubric to evaluate an organization’s current security controls and their effectiveness – the adversarial behavior modeled in the collection may be used to support these and other use cases.
