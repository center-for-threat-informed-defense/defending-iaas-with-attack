Introduction
-------------


Defending IAAS with ATT&CK delivers an approach to generate custom ATT&CK® matrix that reflects adversary behaviors in modern cloud environments.

Organizations using Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) need to understand the techniques adversaries can use against them whether they occur at the cloud management layer, the container technology, or on hosted infrastructure. Organizations seeking a holistic view of adversary activities against IaaS would need to combine techniques across Linux, Cloud (IaaS), and Containers, examining each technique for relevancy to their environment.

Adapting the process outlined in the Cyber Threat Model Methodology, the Defending IaaS with ATT&CK® Project developed a methodology to identify and select techniques across multiple platforms that align to the IaaS attack surface. The procedure provides the community a straightforward and tailorable approach to identify, build, and share collections of techniques to provide a comprehensive view of adversary behavior.

The Defending IaaS with ATT&CK methodology defines the attack surface, specifies platforms to include from the ATT&CK knowledge base, selects criteria to determine applicable techniques, builds the combined set of techniques into a collection, and visualizes the results into a matrix to interactively navigate techniques and create custom views using layers. The resulting collection of techniques can be extended to detect and mitigate adversarial activity.

Use Cases
----------
DIWA is designed to support the following use cases:

        + Passive Cyber Table Top Testing, Adversary Emulation Planning, and Pen Testing.
        + Expand Threat Collection to Security Stack Mappings for your CSP (Azure, AWS , Google Cloud) for protect, detect, and response.
        + End-to-End Threat Model –How this can be applied for multi-cloud interoperable architectures (e.g., employee’s mobile device   (android/IoS), employee’s Windows/MacOS to organization’s leased CSP’s IaaS and/or privately hosted on premise infrastructure).
