Defending IaaS with ATT&CK
==========================

**Defending IaaS With ATT&CK** is a project to create a customized collection of
MITRE ATT&CK® techniques tailored to the unique attack surface and threat model
for **Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)**. This collection can be used to plan
and evaluate security controls for organizations that use IaaS based on the
known adversary behaviors described by ATT&CK. The project methodology is also
documented so that organizations can create their own customized collections
tailored to their unique needs and circumstances.

This project is created and maintained by the `MITRE Engenuity Center for
Threat-Informed Defense <https://ctid.mitre-engenuity.org/>`__ in futherance of
our mission to advance the start of the art and and the state of the practice in
threat-informed defense globally. The project is funded by our `research
participants
